# Vaadin todo app with TypeScript views 

A sample app that uses Vaadin's new type-safe communication between a Spring Boot backend and a LitElement + TypeScript frontend.

## Requirements

* Java 11

## Running

```
mvn spring-boot:run
``` 
Frontend changes are picked up directly. Backend changes need to be built, your IDE may do this automatically on save. 


## Project structure
Frontend files are in `./frontend`
Backend files are in `./src/main/java/com/example/application`
